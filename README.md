   # Ocelot for U-232 V5.5
   
   Heavily modified fork of WhatCD's Ocelot announce daemon
   specifically for U-232 V5.5 tracker codebase.
   
   **NOT compatible with standard Ocelot installations**
   
   Major changes:
   - Database schema adapted to U-232's peers/users/torrents/snatched tables
   - Buffer corruption fixes
   - Connection stability improvements
